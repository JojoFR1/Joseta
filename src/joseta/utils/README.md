### Note
All those folder and files are taken from [Anuken/Arc](https://github.com/Anuken/Arc), 
because default Java implementation is really bad.

[Settings.java](Settings.java), [Strings.java](Strings.java) and [JsonBuilder.java](json/JsonBuilder.java)
are taken from [Xpdustry/Anti-VPN-Service](https://github.com/xpdustry/Anti-VPN-Service).
