# Joseta

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/JojoFR1/Joseta/build.yml?logo=githubactions&style=for-the-badge)

## Project

Joseta is a multi purpose, single server, Discord bot made with the [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA) library.

### Why single server ?

This bot original purpose is to be used in the official [Mindustry France](https://discord.com/invite/hzGPWhZSGV) Discord server only, and so it was made without any plans to support multiple servers nor to be a public bot. Features are also only made based of our needs as of now.

This bot is not *yet* fully usable for personnal use due to multiple hardcoded values, but it is in our plan to make it usable outside of our server. If you wish to use it, we won't give any support for now.

### Why Java and JDA?

We could have used JavaScript or Python. But due to personal preferences, we have chosen Java and JDA, as it was a library we already had experience with.

## Features

This bot is multipurpose and isn't centered around one thing, any features added (removed or changed) are based on our needs. Here's a list of all the features this bot has:

- An **Image based Welcome** for new members (not *yet* configurable)
- A **Goodbye Message** for leaving members (not *yet* configurable)
- **Rules** + an **Acceptation System**, acting as a verification too (not *yet* configurable)
- An **Auto Response** for common questions (not *yet* configurable)
- Multiple commands:

  | Category   | Commands       | Use                                                          |
  |:-----------|:---------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Admin      | `/admin`       | Only used for rules as of now.                               |
  |            | `/config`      | Configure the bot variables for your server.                 |
  | Misc.      | `/ping`        | Get the bot ping.                                            |
  |            | `/multi`       | Send the multiplayer help message manually.                  |
  |            | `/markov`      | Generate a random message using messages sent on the server. |
  | Moderation | `/modlog`      | Acces a member moderation history.                           |
  |            | `/(un)warn`    | (Un)warn a member.                                           |
  |            | `/(un)timeout` | (Un)timeout a member.                                        |
  |            | `/kick`        | Kick a member.                                               |
  |            | `/(un)ban`     | (Un)ban a member.                                            |

## Plans

Our current plans for the future are the following, in the order in which they will be made:

- Add a `/config` command
  - Allow to change *some* variables without having to rebuild and restart
  - Allow to un-hardcode values
  - Allow to be runnable outside of our server

- Send info to user DM about their sanction

- Add a Logging system (on pause PR #6)

- Message leaderboard + levels?

- Support multi-server:
  - Mainly to make it useable outside of our server
  - Make it actually useable for others

## How to build

Building requires **JDK 17** or later.

At the root of the project, use the following command:
`./gradlew shadowJar`

Once the build process is finished, the output will be present in `./build/libs/JosetaBot.jar`.

## How to run

You will first need to follow the instructions in the `secret_template.cfg` file before being able to run the bot.

After this, starting the bot is very easy. You just need to execute this command: `java -jar build/libs/JosetaBot.jar`

The following arguments (after the `.jar`)  are available to use:

- Default: run the bot normally. (Log level is info level)
- `--debug`: run the bot in debug mode. (Log level is debug level & intended for testing)
- `--server`: run the bot in server mode. (Log level is debug level & save log file up to 7 days)
